# Hockey Pool
A website to create and organize a fantasy pool for the NHL. Pick players, and see live stats of how your team is performing against your friends.
#### You can create a game with up to 15 friends and pick a custom game code.

#### Then pick your players, and the stats will update automatically. It will even let you know if that player is injured, by greying out his name.
